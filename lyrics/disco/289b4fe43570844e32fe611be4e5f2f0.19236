It's raining, it's pouring
my lovelife is boring me to tears,
after all these years

No sunshine, no moonlight,
no stardust, no sign of romance
we don't stand a chance

I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover
but he turned out to be like every other man
our love, our love

Raining (raining)
pouring (pouring)
there's nothing left for us here
and we won't waist another tear

If you've had enough,
don't put up with his stuff,
don't you do it
If you've had your fill,
get the check pay the bill,
you can do it

Tell him to just get out
nothing left to talk about
pack his raincoat show him out
just look him in the eyes and simple shout

Enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on, no more no
enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

I've always dreamed to find the perfect lover,
but he turns out to be like every other man
our love (I had no choice from the start)
our love (I've gotta listen to my heart)
our love (tearing us apart)

Enough, is enough, is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
enough, is enough, is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Goodbye mister, goodbye,
goodbye mister, goodbye sugar

No more tears
no more tears
no more tears
I've had it, you've had it, he's had it, we've had it
enough is enough is enough is enough

is enough is enough is enough is enough
is enough is enough is enough is ENOUGH!!!
