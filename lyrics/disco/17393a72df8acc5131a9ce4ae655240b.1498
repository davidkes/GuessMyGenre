I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, I
I never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right to the core
It says "Turn around you fool
You know you love him more and more"
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go!

Chorus
I never can say goodbye boy, uh baby
I never can say goodbye, no, no, no
I never can say goodbye oh no I
I never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
And there's that anguish
There's that doubt
It's that same old dizzy hang-up
I can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so?
Don't wanna let you go!
