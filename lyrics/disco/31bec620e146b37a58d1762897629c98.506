Oh-ho-ho-hoooo (x4)

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting,
those cats were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening,
but they fought with expert timing

There were funky China men from funky Chinatown
They were chopping back up, they were chopping them down
It's an ancient Chinese art, and everybody knew their part
From a faint into a slip, then I'm kickin' from the hip

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting (hunh),
those cats were fast as lightning (hunh)
In fact it was a little bit frightening (hunh),
but they fought with expert timing (hunh)

There was funky Billy Chin and little Sammy Chung
He said, here comes the big boss, let's get it on
He took a bow and made a stand,
started swaying with the hand
A sudden motion made me skip,
now we're into a brand new trick

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting,(hunh)
those kicks were fast as lightning(hunh)
In fact it was a little bit frightening,(hunh)
but they did it with expert timing(hunh)

oh,ho,ho,hoooo (4x)

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting,
those cats were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening,
make sure you have expert timing

Kung Fu fighting, had to be fast as lightning...
