If you should go, go, go, go, go, go,If you should go, go, go, go, go, go,If you should go, go, go, go, go, go,If you should go, go, go, go, go, go.

Que sera de mi vida.
How I'm gonna live without your love
if ever you should go.
Que sera de mi vida.
How I'm gonna find my way alone
if ever you should go.

How can I know what I would do
if I was really losing you
when it isn't true
when it isn't true
How can I know how I'd react
before I have to face the fact
of a broken heart.

If you should go, go, go, go, go, go,If you should go, go, go, go, go, go,If you should go, go, go, go, go, go,If you should go, go, go, go, go, go.

Que sera de mi vida.
How I'm gonna live without your love
if ever you should go.
Que sera de mi vida.
How I'm gonna find my way alone
if ever you should go.

How can I see yopu miles away
I know too well you gonna stay
every night and day
every night and day
you never know just what you've got
you only feel it means a lot
when it's gone and lost.

If you should go, go, go, go, go, go,If you should go, go, go, go, go, go,If you should go, go, go, go, go, go,If you should go, go, go, go, go, go.

Que sera de mi vida.
How I'm gonna live without your love
if ever you should go.
Que sera de mi vida.
How I'm gonna find my way alone
if ever you should go.

Que sera de mi vida ?
