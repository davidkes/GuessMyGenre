Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow, yeah
Everywhere the child went
The little lamb was sure to go, yeah
He followed her to school one day
And broke the teachers rule
What a time did they have
That day at school

Tisket! tasket! baby
A green and yellow basket
Sent a letter to my baby
On my way I past it
