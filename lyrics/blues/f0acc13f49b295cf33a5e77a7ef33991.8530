What the hell is wrong with you tonight,
I cant seem to say or do the right thing,
Wanted to be sure your feeling right,
Wanted to be sure we want the same thing.

She said,
I can't believe it,
You can't,
Possibly mean it,
Don't we,
All want the same thing,
Don't we,
Well who said anything about love.....

No, not love she said,
Dont you know that it's different for girls,
(Don't give me love)
No, not love she said,
Dont you know that it's different for girls,
You're all the same.

Mama always told me save yourself,
Take a little time and find the right girl,
Then again don't end up on the shelf,
Logical advice gets you in a whirl.

I know,
A lot of things that,
You don't,
You wanna here some,
She said,
Just give me something,
Anything,
Well give me all you got without love,

No, not love she said,
Don't you know that it's different for girls,
(Don't give me love)
No, not love she said,
Don't you know that it's different for girls,
You're all the same..........

Who said anything about love.........

No, not love she said,
Don't you know that it's different for girls,
(Don't give me love)
No, not love she said,
Dont you know that it's different for girls X2

Your all the same (repeat X4, fading out)
