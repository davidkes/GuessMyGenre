How did I ever let you slip away
Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more
Ever since you closed the door

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine

Funny, funny how time goes by
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye
Woah, why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering
When every day I pray please come back to me

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you would be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine

And you had enough love for the both of us
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you would be mine, woah
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you'd still be mine

I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back)
Never do you wrong (If I could turn back)
And never leave your side (If I could turn back)
If I could turn back the hands

(If I could turn back)
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall
(If I could turn back)
Then I'd come to realize howmuch I love you
Love you (If I could turn back the hands)
Love you (If I could turn back the hands)
Love you (If I could turn back the hands)
