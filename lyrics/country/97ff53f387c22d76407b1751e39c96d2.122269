I've seen him as he awakens in the morning
He reaches out his hand and without a word
As his fingers softly fall upon my face
He lights the flame of desire and makes me want him
And love is the foundation we lean on all you need is love to ease your mind
And does it have to be right to be called love
When he gives me more loving then a lifetime of looking could ever find
And love is the foundation we lean on...
