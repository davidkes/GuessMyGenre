I lie Here tonite in the darkness
I've never felt so alone.
Tommorow I'll wake up still lonesome
Cause things havn't canged since you've gone
You walked out with angry words spoken
Your leavin' cut right to the bone
I'll pick up the pieces you have broken
Find the strength to go on
I still remember
My arms once held her
How long do old memories last?
Why can't I forget it?
Why can't I admit it?
There ain't no future in the past
I still remember
My arms once held her
How long do old memories last?
Why can't I forget it?
Why can't I admit it?
There ain't no future in the past
Why can't I forget it?
Why can't I admit it?
There ain't no future in the past
