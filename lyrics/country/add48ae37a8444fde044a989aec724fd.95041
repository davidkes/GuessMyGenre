Oh Yeah, sure, no problem
I'll just throw away
these feelings
Let go of all these hopes
and never think of you

No offense, but you've lost it
if you think
I'll just forget you
and decide that
I don't love you
do you realize what
you're tellin' me to do

Chorus:
It's like sayin' don't breathe
or don't blink
Well darlin' I don't think you
understand
See, I can't just turn this off
It's like sayin' don't eat
or don't sleep
Our love's just
one of those things
that I've gotten used to doin'
way too long

You don't have to worry
I'm not gonna stop you
you can pack up
all your things
and head on out that door

But don't stand there
and tell me
How you think it would be best
to leave my feelings in the past
and not allow myself to love
you anymore

Chorus
It's like sayin' don't eat
or don't sleep
our love's just one of those things
that I've gotten used to doin' way too long
