The season for the rodeo is over
And he's usually back home this time of year
But I haven't heard a word since
He called me from Santa Fe
Something in his voice said you were stealing him away

New Mexico - have i lost him to your sunset
Do your mountains life him higher than my love
New Mexico - guess we'll have to wait and see
If tomorrow's gonna bring him back to me

He said he'd never seen a place more beautiful
And he talked of maybe moving there someday
Where the stars in the sky shine like diamonds every night
I wonder if he sees those stars in someone else's eyes

New Mexico - have i lost him to your sunset
Do your mountains life him higher than my love
New Mexico - guess we'll have to wait and see
If tomorrow's gonna bring him back to me
