(Brad Paisley/Chris DuBois)

West Texas forecast more of the same
Sunny and mild, no chance of rain
That ol' John Deere tractor ain't moved in days
Oh, but he's out there climbin' back on
Because he's yet to admit that his crops are all gone.

She stares out the window fightin' back tears
And watches him wastin' his time in the fields
They're havin' problems payin' the bills
Oh, and she knows that it won't be long
Before the bank finally places a lien on the farm.

Chorus:
And the tractor keeps rollin'
The dust rises high
Creatin' the only cloud in the sky
He's holdin' his ground
But it's gettin' tough
He's keepin' his faith
In the Lord up above
And prayin' for rain
Through a cloud of dust.

Yesterday somethin' in town caught his eye
The old hardware store had a "Help wanted" sign
He thought about stoppin' but he drove on by
'Cause he just can't bear to let go
After all it's the only life he's ever known.

Chorus:
And the tractor keeps rollin'
The dust rises high
Creatin' the only cloud in the sky
He's holdin' his ground
But it's gettin' tough
He's keepin' his faith
In the Lord up above
And prayin' for rain
Through a cloud of dust.

Yeah, he's holdin' his ground
But it's gettin' tough
He's keepin' his faith
In the Lord up above
And prayin' for rain
Through a cloud of dust.

West Texas forecast more of the same
Sunny and mild, no chance of rain...
