I've cried so much lately that I've made out of list
Of things to remember things to forget
But my mind can't seperate all the joy from regret
I'll always remember the things to forget.

Things to remember the day that we've met
The day that we've parted things to forget
Why won't my heart let me do it this way
With just things to remember today.

--- Instrumental ---

Things to remember plans that were set
Plans didn't work out things to forget
Why won't my heart let me do it this way
With just things to remember today.

Oh, things to remember the day that we've met
The day that we've parted things to forget
Why won't my heart let me do it this way
With just things to remember today.

Oh, things to remember today.
Oh, things to remember today...
