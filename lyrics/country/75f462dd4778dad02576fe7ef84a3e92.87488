I don't want to be standing here
With this ticket for this outbound plane
'Cause I've been here before
And somehow it doesn't feel the same
Talk is cheap, so we could talk all night long
We may never figure out just where our love went wrong.

AndI don't wanna be standin' here
And I don't wanna be talkin' here
And I don't really care who's to blame
'Cause if love won't fly on its own free will
It's gonna catch that outbound plane.

The old folks say loves not forever anymore
Because these young people walk away
From love alone, to pace the floor
Young or old I say that love is still the same
And you may walk away from love
But you'll fall head and heel again.

AndI don't wanna be standin' here
And I don't wanna be talkin' here
And I don't really care who's to blame
'Cause if love won't fly on its own free will
It's gonna catch that outbound plane.

Two lonely hearts in this aiport knowing
Neither cares where that other heart is going
But if love won't fly on its own free will
It's gonna catch that outbound plane.

That crown you're wearin'
Is just your halo turned upside down
Where is the laughter we once shared
Back in the lost and found
These broken wings are gonna leave me here
To stand my ground
You can have this ticket
For that lonely plane thats flyin' out.

I don't wanna be standin' here
And I don't wanna be talkin' here
And I don't really care who's to blame
'Cause if love won't fly on its own free will
It's gonna catch that outbound plane.

If love won't fly on its own free will
It's gonna catch that outbound plane...
