GIVE ME ONE MORE LAST CHANCE

She was standing at the front door
when I came home last night
with a Good Book in her left hand
and a rolling pin in her right
she said you'd come home for the last time
with the whiskey on your breath
if you don't listen to my preaching boy
I'm gonna have to beat you half to death

Give me just a one more last chance
before you say we're through
I know I drive you crazy baby
it's the best that i can do
were just some good ol boys
a making noise
I ain't runnin around on you
Give me just a one more last chance
before you say we're through

first she hit my glasses
because ya know that I can't see
she said you ain't going nowhere boy
til you spend a little time with me
then the boys called from the honky tonk
said there's a party going on down here
well she might have took my car keys
but she forgot about my old John Deere

Gimme just a one more last chance
before you say we're through
I know I drive you crazy baby
it's the best that i can do
were just some good ol boys
making noise
I ain't runnin round on you
Gimme just a one more last chance
before you say we're through
SOLO
Gimme just one more last chance
before you say we're through
I know I drive you crazy baby
it's the best that I can do
were just some good ol boys
making noise
I ain't runnin around on you
Gimme just a one more last chance
before you say we're through

give me just one more last chance
before you say we're through
