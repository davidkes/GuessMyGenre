Here she comes, just like an angel
Seems like forever that she's been on my mind
But nothing has changed
She thinks I'm a waste of her time

There she goes, she don't know what she's missing
Can't she see I'll never give up the fight
I'll do all I can till she understands my desire

I'm on the outside lookin in
Let me into your heart - oh
There's nothing on earth that
Should keep us apart

Chorus:
I can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to same me from being alone
'Cause I can't live without your love

So I wait, here for an answer
And wonder if tomorrow will be like yesterday
I'll keep holding on
Can't go on living this way, Baby

I've been on the outside looking in
Bring these tears to an end - oh
I realize it's no use for me to pretend
Oh yeah

Chorus:
I can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
'Cause I can't live without your love

For your love... I'd put my arms around you
For your love... I'd find the strength to tell you
For your love... That I can't live without your

Chorus:
I can't live without your love and affection
I just can't go on this way anymore
As hard as I try there's one thing that I know for sure
I can't live without your love
I can't live without your love
