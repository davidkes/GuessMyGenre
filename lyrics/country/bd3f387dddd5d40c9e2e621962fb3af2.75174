(Rosanne Cash - Vince Gill)

You were like a lost kid looking for home
You found what you wanted right in my arms
So if you walk out on me just leave your memory
Take my sympathy and go I love you so you're never alone.

So if you find another woman turns your head
And you can't understand why it hurts so bad
If you walk out on me just leave your memory
Take my sympathy and go I love you so you're never alone.

There ain't no need to talk about it
I can learn to live without it
Just leave your heart right here with me.

--- Instrumental ---

If you walk out on me just leave your memory
Take my sympathy and go
If you walk out on me just leave your memory
Take my sympathy and go I love you so you're never alone.

No you're never alone.
No you're never alone.
No you're never alone...
