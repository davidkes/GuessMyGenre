(Reed Nielsen - Vince Gill)

You've got my number you've got my name
So why don't you call me little Liza Jane
You've got that body you've got that frame
So why don't you call me little Liza Jane.

Girl I got it bad for you
There ain't nothing I won't do
Just one kiss and I'll never be the same
Little Liza Jane, Oh, little Liza Jane.

--- Instrumental ---

Now you've heard my story
You've got to know my name
So why don't you call me
Little Liza Jane.

Girl I got it bad for you
There ain't nothing I won't do
Just one kiss and I'll never be the same
Little Liza Jane, Oh, little Liza Jane.

Oh, little Liza Jane, oh, little Liza Jane...
