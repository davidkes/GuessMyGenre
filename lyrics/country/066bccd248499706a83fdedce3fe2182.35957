Forgiving you was easy,forgeting seems to take the longest time.
I just keep thinking and your memory is forever on my mind.
You know I'll aways love you and I can't forget the day when you were mine.

Forgiving you was easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time.

The bitter fruit of anger growing from the seeds of jealousy.
Oh what a heart ache but I forgive the things you said to me.
For I believe forgiving is the only way I'll find peace of mind.

Forgiving you was easy but forgeting seems to take the longest time.

The years have past so quickly,
As once again they've sealed a young man's dream of all the golden years
And growing old together you and me.

You ask me to forgive you.
You said there was another on your mind,
Forgiving you was easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time....
