What do you get when you fall in love?
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble
That's what you get for all your trouble
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

What do you get when you kiss a guy
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
After you do, she'll never phone ya
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

Don't tell me what it's all about
'cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out
Out of those chains those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you

what do you get when you give your heart you get it all broken up and battered
Thats what you get, a heart thats shattered, I'll never fall in love again

Out of those chains those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you

What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lies and pain and sorrow
So far at least until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love a- gain
I'll never fall in love a- gain
